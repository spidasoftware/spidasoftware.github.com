## Introduction

Welcome to the spida website.  We have put together a much documentation here as we can manage.

We have put a lot of work into our API's and published them here for your ease of use.

All of the code for our API is contained in the open source project [here](https://github.com/spidasoftware/schema).

### Documentation

JavaDocs and other developer related documentation can be found here as well.
